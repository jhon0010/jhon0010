# Hi there! 👋 I'm Jhon, a Software Engineer

With over 12 years of experience in various software engineering roles—especially in software architecture, data engineering, and backend development—I specialize in building **robust, distributed systems** with a strong focus on **microservices** and **event-driven architectures** using Pub/Sub, Kafka, or other brokers.

In addition to my core backend skills in **Java (Spring Boot)**, I’ve developed practical expertise in **Python** for **data pipelines, testing, and serverless automation**, and have experience across both **GCP** and **AWS** cloud ecosystems.
